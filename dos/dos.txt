- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks overload a system, making it inaccessible to users.

Secure Version: Prevents DoS by limiting request rates and using intrusion detection systems.

Additional Security Mechanisms:

Traffic Filtering: Firewalls and WAFs block malicious traffic.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Distributes traffic across servers, absorbs DDoS attacks.
Failover and Redundancy: Backup systems maintain availability.
Behavioral Analysis: Detects anomalies in user behavior.
DDoS Protection Services: Specialized services mitigate large-scale attacks.
