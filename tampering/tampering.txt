Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability

The insecure version doesn't sanitize user input, making it 
vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In contrast, 
the secure version sanitizes input using the escapeHTML() function, 
preventing XSS vulnerabilities by escaping special characters.
